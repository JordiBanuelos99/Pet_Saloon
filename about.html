                            <p>Hello, my name is Jordi Bañuelos Mendez. I was born in Tijuana in 1999 and have lived in this city most of my life. I'm currently 22 years old and studying engineering informatics at the Technological Institute of Tijuana (or in spanish, Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana), where I learned some of the basics in programming and coding in a few platforms and languages like C#, SQL and HTML; however, years have passed without me practicing, meaning that I lost a lot of knowledge, so this course will definitely help me extend my current knowledge and learn more besides school teachings.</p>
                            <p>Like a lot of people of my generation, I grew up using computers and a few other affordable technologies at the time to view, create or edit content. During my adolescence I dedicated more time to other activities like studying or playing soccer at school, although I kept my interest in the other activities. All these activities made me have a lot of interest in computer programming, multimedia editing, and even 3D modeling, even though I'm way too far from being an expert on all of them.</p>
